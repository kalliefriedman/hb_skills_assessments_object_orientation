Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.

   -Encapsulation: Data lives close to its functionality, which becomes particularly useful when building larger programs
   -Abstraction: We only need to understand what a method does in order to use it, and allows us to disociate this from how the method does it
   -Polymorphism: Allows us to make different interchangable types of an object (interchangabability of components)

2. What is a class?

3. What is an instance attribute?

4. What is a method?

5. What is an instance in object orientation?

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.
